# SWATSIM
This program allows you to project success rates of offensive/defensive SWAT-style raids. It allows you to both design your own scenarios and run real-time simulations. This program (will be) HIVE-Certified for more complex raids consisting of several hundred troops, high-resolution timeframing, or multi-pass simulation.
